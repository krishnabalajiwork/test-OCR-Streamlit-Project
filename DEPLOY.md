## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Deployment Options

### Docker Deployment
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    tesseract-ocr \
    tesseract-ocr-eng \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements and install Python dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8501

# Run the application
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
```

Build and run:
```bash
docker build -t ocr-streamlit .
docker run -p 8501:8501 ocr-streamlit
```

### Local Development Server
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Tesseract (system-dependent)
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-eng
# macOS: brew install tesseract
# Windows: Download from GitHub

# Run locally
streamlit run app.py
```

## üîß Environment Variables (Optional)

You can customize the app behavior using environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT` | Server port | 8501 |
| `STREAMLIT_SERVER_ADDRESS` | Server address | localhost |
| `TESSERACT_CMD` | Tesseract command path | tesseract |

### Setting Environment Variables

**Streamlit Cloud**: Go to App Settings ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Environment Variables

**Hugging Face**: Add to `secrets.toml` file:
```toml
TESSERACT_CMD = "/usr/bin/tesseract"
```

**Railway**: Set in dashboard under Variables tab

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. "Requirements not found" Error
- **Solution**: Ensure `requirements.txt` is in the root directory
- **Check**: File name is exactly `requirements.txt` (not `requirements.txt.txt`)

### 2. "Tesseract not found" Error
- **Solution**: Ensure `packages.txt` includes `tesseract-ocr` and `tesseract-ocr-eng`
- **Platform**: Some platforms may not support system packages

### 3. "EAST model download failed" Error
- **Solution**: Check internet connectivity on deployment platform
- **Alternative**: Pre-download model and include in repository (if size allows)

### 4. "Port already in use" Error
- **Solution**: Use environment variable `PORT` or change default port
- **Local**: Kill existing processes on port 8501

### 5. Memory/Resource Limits
- **Solution**: Optimize image processing, reduce model size if possible
- **Upgrade**: Consider paid tiers for more resources

   - Error messages
   - Steps to reproduce

## üéâ Post-Deployment

After successful deployment:

1. **Test all features** (upload, camera, text extraction)
2. **Share your app** with the community
3. **Monitor usage** through platform dashboards
4. **Update regularly** to keep dependencies current
5. **Gather feedback** from users for improvements
